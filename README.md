# RimWorld XML Schema files

---

This is a collection of implied XML schema files in .xsd format for RimWorld mod development, inspired by the work of [Sam Hunt](https://github.com/sam-hunt/RimworldXsd). These files' rules were referenced primarily via the [information publicly available on the RimWorld wiki](https://rimworldwiki.com/wiki/Modding_Tutorials).

This project only contains metadata files for RimWorld mods for now as I am uncertain of the legal ramifications of distributing schema for RimWorld's Defs. If you're interested in .xsd for those, check out my bugfix-fork of [RimWorld XSD Schema Generator](https://github.com/Ragonfana/RimworldXsd)

XML schema appears opinionated by design, so your validator will require your About.xml to be structured in a specific way that is not technically required by RimWorld. I attempted to structure elements in a way that is human-readable.

I do not typically work with xml or xml schema language, so there may be errors. Open to PRs. W3schools has an [excellent guide and reference on XML Schema Language](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/schema_intro.asp).
